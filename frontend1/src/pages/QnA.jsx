  { question: 'Who is this for?', answer: 'Anyone in the early stages of their tech journey — students, career switchers, or anyone feeling a little lost trying to break into the field.' },
  { question: 'Are the articles beginner-friendly?', answer: 'Absolutely! We assume you\'re smart but not necessarily experienced. No gatekeeping, just clear, friendly guidance.' },
  { question: 'What\'s up with the quizzes and badges?', answer: 'At the end of most posts, you can take a quick quiz to lock in what you’ve learned. Score well? You earn a digital badge for fun and bragging rights.' },
  { question: 'Why did you make this?', answer: 'We’ve both been through the confusion and pressure of trying to break into tech. This is the resource we wish we had when we were starting.' },
  { question: 'Can I suggest a topic?', answer: 'Yes, please! We love feedback and ideas. Reach out through our contact form or comment on a post.' },
  { question: 'Is this free?', answer: 'Yup. 100% free and passion-powered.' },
